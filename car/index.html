              <h2>Ownership and licensing of trademarks</h2>
              <p>In 1998, Vickers decided to sell Rolls-Royce Motors. The most likely buyer was BMW, who already supplied engines and other components for Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars, but BMW's final offer of £340 million was beaten by Volkswagen's £430 million.
              A stipulation in the ownership documents of Rolls-Royce dictated that Rolls-Royce plc, the aero-engine maker, would retain certain essential trademarks, including the Rolls-Royce name and logo if the automotive division was sold. Although Vickers plc sold the vehicle designs, nameplates, administrative headquarters, production facilities, Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grill shape trademarks to Volkswagen AG, Rolls-Royce plc chose to license the Rolls-Royce name and logo to BMW AG for £40 million, because Rolls-Royce plc had recently had joint business ventures with BMW.</p>

                <p style="border-style: solid";>The turn of the 20th century marked the beginning of an extraordinary partnership between two of the most innovative minds of the moment. Henry Royce, a successful engineer and Charles Rolls, owner of one of the UK’s first motor car dealerships, agreed to sell motor cars under the name Rolls-Royce.At that moment, a new company was born: Rolls-Royce.</p>
                <p style="border-style: solid">The 1940s saw new developments in craftsmanship and design. Until 1959, each Silver Wraith had an individual, coach-built body.</p>

            <section class="grid_5.5" >
                <p style="border-style: solid;align:right"> After faultlessly completing the 1913 Alpine Trial – a 14,371-mile drive through some of the toughest mountain terrain – the Silver Ghost had demonstrated such a level of comfort and reliability that critics named it ‘The Best Car in the World’</p>

                <p style="border-style: solid;text-align: center;">In the 1930s, Rolls-Royce broke world records on land and sea. And automation saw the arrival of Phantom III – the first ever Rolls-Royce to be built with a V12 engine.
                Just three years on from that seminal moment, Rolls-Royce produced the 1907 Silver Ghost, the motor car that founded the marque’s legendary status.</p>
